# Advent Of Code edition 2020

Those are my solutions for [AdventOfCode 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). I continue to learn C# by making some projects, but sometimes I need to improve my knowledge by doing some small programming challenges. This is why I created this repo(This new repo contains the old one from GitHub but with better solution management). The first 3 days are my old programs from the beginning of 2022, they are not perfect to be sure. In these 3 days, you have to manually change the file path! Other days will have this fixed.


## Installation

Download the latest version of this project (take the version from the main branch)

In DayXChallangeY.cs change the path to your input, and X is days 1 to 3, Y is Challange 1 or 2.

In Program.cs uncomment selected by your challenge to see the solution.

Type run method to run the application

```bash
dotnet run
```
